      We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing
      coffee to you. Thatâ€™s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into
      farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is
      grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about
      coffee farming on our blog.
